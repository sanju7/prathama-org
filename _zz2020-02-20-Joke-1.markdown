Priest - What sins have you done, son?
Sam - I went to send something to my sister in law and before going out it started raining, so i stayed in her house and things heated up and i fucked her .

Priest - That's a big sin Son. Do you regret it ?
Sam - No Father .. I tired to avoid. But Rain ruined it.
Priest -   Son  I forgive you.

Sam - Thank you father but i have sinned another time, i went to my mother in law to send her something and before going out it started raining, so i stayed in her house and things heated up and i fucked her as well.
Priest - Do you regret  this time Son ?
